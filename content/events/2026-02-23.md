## Description

Is your professional headshot due for a refresh? On the 23rd of February, we will be hosting a workshop where you can get your picture taken 📸 right at SEA (formerly EASV).

Alongside the photoshoot, we will have a personal branding workshop where you can get peer feedback on your CV, LinkedIn profile, or any other materials you want to polish. Whether you're looking to update your LinkedIn profile or prepare for job applications, or thinking about how to stand out when you're looking for an internship, this workshop will provide you with valuable insights and practical advice.

Let’s ensure your first impression is your best impression!
