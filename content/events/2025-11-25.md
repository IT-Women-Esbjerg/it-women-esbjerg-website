## Description

Let's wrap up the year together!

As we have previously shared, on the 7th of December at 14:00 (Sunday), we will be meeting up for the last IT Women Esbjerg event in 2025, which will take place at Dronning Louise.

Come join us for a cup of a cozy, warm beverage ☕, and let's reflect on and celebrate this year together.

Please let us know if you can make it, so we can book an appropriate table 😊.
